# Corrently-Current

Corrently-Current is a quickly nailed-together *something* to collect and display energy data in a horrible mobile user interface. Corrently-Current is the name of the UI  components that could be built as a standalone Android app, deployed to a server or as an executable to use on a desktop. The Corrently-Current *something* makes heavily use of MQTT.
